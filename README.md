# DistractMeNot-Chrome-Extension
A basic productivity Chrome Extension that allows users to input a list of site(s) they wish to not distract them while surfing the internet. From the URLs submitted to the plugin, it will then actively keep a lookout for the URLs. If the URLs are detected, the extension will automatically close the tab or window.

# Why I Made This
I made it because I find myself wasting time on some sites sometimes on a daily basis, and I wanted a free, lightweight tool to automatically close the windows for me whenever I visit those sites (e.g. Discord, Agar.io, etc.) without having to permanently block those sites via parental control tools. I'm confident enough to have enough self discipline where I won't need a lock mechanism on this plugin so I kept it simple.
